# Algorithm Analysis by Chris Harris

This is a simple console based application that generates a set number of random integers and then uses multiple algorithms to determine the efficiency of each. This is to also be used with Visual Studioâ€™s built in Profiler to see the speed of each as well as other information obtained while executing the algorithm in question. This is simply for learning purposes and to show how different ways of coding algorithms does make a huge difference!
